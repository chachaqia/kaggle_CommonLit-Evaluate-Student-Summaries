# kaggle_CommonLit-Evaluate-Student-Summaries
While studying Machine Learning and Data Mining, our lecturer asked us to work as a team on a big project. Our group chose to participate in a recent kaggle competition. This is where we do data cleaning, feature selection, model training, prediction, and multi-model comparison. It also achieved good results in the final evaluation.
